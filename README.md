# RBAC-example
This simple python code is designed to be a basic example of 
Role Based Access Control(RBAC). By limiting user's choices 
and available information through the use of roles, this code
strongly focuses on the C of the CIA Triad, Confidentiality.

The code features two hard-coded users. The first is a standard
user / customer. The second is an admin user.

*User 1 Log-in
-username: user1
-password: password

*User 2 Log-in
-username: user2
-password: password

Any attempts to log-in to an account other than these two will
result in a generic error message, which is an important aspect
for authentication.

*NOTE: Once logged in, your options are case-sensitive so input your
choices exactly as you see them presented.
